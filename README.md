# Obsidian Auto Tagger

A simple project to help organise my Obsidian Vault while also learning how to work with LLMs and related technologies. Most of this project will be done for the purpose of learning so the decisions are largely based around that.

## Project Goals:
- Given an input of existing tags (ones that are already in use in my vault) and note content, instruct an LLM to return a list of tags that should be assigned to the note.
- Allow the LLM to create new tags if non from the existing tag list are suitable.
- Automatically update the note with the tags. 
- Learn things.
